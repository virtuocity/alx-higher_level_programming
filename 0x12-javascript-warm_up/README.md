# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Background Context

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end

## Install Node 14

```console
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Install semi-standard

[Documentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)

```console
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Notes

### Variables

are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword,
followed by the name you give to the variable:

```javascript
let myVar;
```

is how you would declare a var in js

**Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.**
e.g

```javascript
let myVar = document.querySelector("h1");
```

conditionals:

```javascript
let iceCream = "chocolate";
if (iceCream === "chocolate") {
  alert("Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!");
} else {
  alert("Awwww, but chocolate is my favoriteâ€¦");
}
```

=== means strictly equal, This performs a test to see if two values are equal and
of the same data type.  
notice the opening and closing curly brackets but the construct is the same as in C
or python  
semicolon similarity with c PL

## Functions

You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function
which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:

```javascript
function multiply(num1, num2) {
  let result = num1 * num2;
  return result;
}
```

### Event handlers

re code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the _click_ event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.

```javascript
document.querySelector("html").addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Ouch! Stop poking me!");
});
```

There are a number of ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the <html> element. We then call its addEventListener() function, passing in the name of the event to listen for ('click') and a function to run when the event happens.

The function we just passed to addEventListener() here is called an anonymous function, because it doesn't have a name. There's an alternative way of writing anonymous functions, which we call an arrow function. An arrow function uses () => instead of function ():

```javascript
document.querySelector("html").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Ouch! Stop poking me!");
});
```
