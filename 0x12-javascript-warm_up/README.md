# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Background Context

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end

## Install Node 14

```console
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Install semi-standard

[Documentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)

```console
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Notes

### Variables

are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword,
followed by the name you give to the variable:

```javascript
let myVar;
```

is how you would declare a var in js

**Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.**
e.g

```javascript
let myVar = document.querySelector("h1");
```

conditionals:

```javascript
let iceCream = "chocolate";
if (iceCream === "chocolate") {
  alert("Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!");
} else {
  alert("Awwww, but chocolate is my favoriteâ€¦");
}
```

notice the opening and closing curly brackets but the construct is the same as in C
or python
semicolon similarity with c PL
